This is a slimmed down version of the original Print.h Arduino library.
The intent is to have a smaller prog mem a ram footprint. To achieve this, the String and Printable were removed, along with the error methods.

```c
    testMe.print(123);
    testMe.println(456);
    testMe.print(F("asdf!"));
    testMe.println(F("qwer?"));
    testMe.print("hjk");
    testMe.println("zui");
```

Original:
  Sketch uses 1286 bytes (3%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
  Global variables use 37 bytes (1%) of dynamic memory, leaving 2011 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.

TinyPrint:

  Global variables use 27 bytes (1%) of dynamic memory, leaving 2021 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.

This may not be a gigantic gain over the original Print.h, but if you are developing for a small device (eg.: ATTINY13), these few bytes can mean the world :)
